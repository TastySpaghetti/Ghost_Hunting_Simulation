COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS:
	You can type 'make' into the compiler and it will compile into a file called 'proj'
	If for some reason the make file does not work, use the following command:
		gcc -o proj main.c ghost.c room.c evidence.c hunter.c building.c defs.h
	enter './proj' to run the program

DESCRIPTION OF MAIN PROGRAM
	The program will prompt you to enter 4 names, which should be entered on the same line space separated. No input will be required after that. The program will then initialize 4 hunters, starting at the van, and 1 ghost, starting in any random location excluding the van. Each hunter and the ghost will be given a thread for them to work with and begin their hunt for the ghost. The ghost and hunters actions are decided purely randomly.
